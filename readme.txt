 WATCHER

     WATCHER is an idle terminal monitor.  That is, it logs out interactive
 users after a certain period of inactivity.  WATCHER is fully configurable,
 allowing the system manager to define which terminals to watch, what
 measurements to use, and how long a terminal should be idle before getting
 zapped.  It also includes provisions for preventing logouts or overriding
 inactivity settings based on any combination of username, UIC, terminal,
 privileges, image being run, held identifier, and time of day.

 WATCHER runs on VAX/VMS V5.4 and later, OpenVMS Alpha V6.1 and later,
 and OpenVMS Industry Standard 64 V8.2 and later.
